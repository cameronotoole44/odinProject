    <p1>Irish Champ is similar to Colcannon but instead of cabbage, it's made by blending green onions or scallions with
        cream mashed potatoes.</p1>

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>2 pounds potatoes, peeled and halved</li>
        <li>1 cup of milk</li>
        <li>1 bunch of thinly sliced green onions</li>
        <li>1/4 cup butter</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon salt, or to taste</li>
        <li>freshly ground black pepper to taste</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Place potatoes into a large pot and cover with salted water; bring to a boil. Reduce the heat to medium-low
            and simmer
            until tender, about 20 minutes.</li>
        <li>Drain potatoes well, then return to the pot and cover with a clean dish towel. Place the pot over very low
            heat until
            potatoes are dry, 2 to 3 minutes.</li>
        <li>Meanwhile, heat the milk and green onion in a saucepan over medium-low heat until warm, 3 to 4 minutes.</li>
        <li>Once potatoes are dry, add butter and salt; mash with a potato masher until smooth. Stir in warm milk
            mixture until well
            combined, then season with pepper.</li>
    </ol>
